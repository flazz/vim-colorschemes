# ChangeLog for xterm16.vim
xterm16-2.43
    2006-09-12 Gautam Iyer <gautam@math.stanford.edu>
    - Added highlighting groups for the Tab line (thanks to Paddy Newman).

xterm16-2.42
    2006-05-18 Gautam Iyer <gautam@math.uchicago.edu>
    - Removed "tags" file from distribution (duh) (Thanks to Suresh
      Govindachar / "cga2000" for pointing it out).
    - Glaring error in documentation: Old version asked you to set t_Co=16
      instead of 256 (thanks to Zdenek Sekera for pointing it out).
    - Minor highlighting group bug fixes.

xterm16-2.41
    2006-04-16 Gautam Iyer <gautam@math.uchicago.edu>
    - Forgot to add highlighting groups for 'cursorrow' and 'cursorcollumn' in
      some color maps. Thanks to Georg Dahn for pointing this out.

    - In the all blue colormap, Comment and Identifier were similar colors.
      This is especially bad in perl programs say. Changed it so that no other
      color is similar to Comment, thus comments can easily be found.

xterm16-2.4
    2006-04-03 Gautam Iyer <gautam@math.uchicago.edu>
    - Added an "allblue" colormap: This makes most foreground colors a shade
      of blue for least eyestrain.

    - Added a "softlight" colormap: This has a white background for web
      hosting / etc.

    - Added extra highlighting groups from Vim-7 (is still backward compatible
      to Vim-6.4)

xterm16-2.2
    2005-05-26 Gautam Iyer <gautam@math.uchicago.edu>
    - Added mrxvt and rxvt 256 color support (options xterm16_termtype and
      xterm16_ccube).

    - Added the program rgb_level to get the intensities of a uniform rgbi
      color cube and a patch to set the mrxvt color cube.

    - Allowed xterm16bg_Group & xterm16fg_Group to contain color names (from
      this colorscheme). Thus setting xterm16bg_Normal='none' gives
      transparency in mrxvt :)

    - A trivial perl script to generate a custom terminal 6x6x6 color cube,
      the Xresources file from xterm16_palette, and CSS files for web hosting.

    - Few minor color modifications to the soft colormap.

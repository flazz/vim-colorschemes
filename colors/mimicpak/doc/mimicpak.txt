1. Introduction						*mimic-intro*

The MimicPak is a set of colorschemes which were converted from other editors
and IDEs and that share some common tweaking options (see: |mimic-options|).
Some original, personal, invented and/or cloned colorschemes are included too
(see: |mimic-converted|, |mimic-originals|, |mimic-cloned|).

Most of the IDEs/Editors may have had more colorschemes, but only some are
included.  Note that most of the colorschemes are only for |gvim|, this is so,
because of time reasons and available number of colors.  Although some of them
have the cterm colors for 16 color terminals (see: |mimic-overview| to know
which ones).

Most of the included colorschemes are intended to be "easy on the eyes", and I
hope that you might find at least 2 or 3 colorschemes from this pack that you
could use for every day coding :).  For an overview of colorschemes by
background color see: |mimic-dark-schemes| and |mimic-light-schemes|.

For a fast way to try out these schemes, the included "mimicpak.vim" script
creates a submenu "MimicPak" under the "Themes" menu on the main menubar, and
which is {only available for Vim version >= 6.0}, and {only if Vim is compiled
with the |+menu| feature}.

You can avoid loading the menu by setting the variable: >
	:let  g:loaded_mimicpak = 1	" or any other value that you like.
somewhere in your |.vimrc|.

	'--------------------'--------'-------'-------------'

	NOTE:
	in the following sections, the expression "without other options"
	means "without other colorscheme specific options".
	In other words:  options that are NOT the shared |mimic-options|.

2.1. Dark Colorschemes					*mimic-dark-schemes*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   o  Almost Black backgrounds (Grey20 == #333333 == "a la Desert"): ~
	* |astroboy.vim|, without other options.
	* |bigbang.vim|, without other options.
	* |dejavu.vim|, by setting 'bg' to "dark", without other options.
	* |masmed.vim|, by setting |mimic_masmed_alt| to a non-Zero value.
	* |paradox.vim|, by setting |mimic_paradox_alt| to a non-Zero value.
	* |psclone.vim|.
	* |vimhut.vim|, by setting 'bg' to "dark".

   o  Black backgrounds: ~
	* |astroboy.vim|, by setting |mimic_astroboy_dark| to non-Zero value.
	* |bigbang.vim|, by setting |mimic_bigbang_dark| to non-Zero value.
	* |dejavu.vim|, by setting 'bg' to "dark" and
			the |mimic_dejavu_dark| option to non-Zero.
	* |zendnb.vim|.

   o  Blue backgrounds: ~
	* |astroboy.vim|, by setting |mimic_astroboy_alt| to a non-Zero value.
	* |bigbang.vim|, by setting |mimic_bigbang_alt| to a non-Zero value.
	* |dejavu.vim|, by setting 'bg' to "dark" and
			the |mimic_dejavu_alt| option to non-Zero.

   o  Dark Blue backgrounds: ~
	* |astroboy.vim|, by setting the options |mimic_astroboy_alt| and
			|mimic_astroboy_dark| to non-Zero values.
	* |bigbang.vim|, by setting the options |mimic_bigbang_alt| and
			|mimic_bigbang_dark| to non-Zero values.
	* |deepblue.vim|.
	* |dejavu.vim|, by setting 'bg' to "dark", the |mimic_dejavu_dark|
			and the |mimic_dejavu_alt| option to non-Zero.

   o  Dark Purple backgrounds: ~
	* |masmed.vim|, without other options.

   o  Dark Teal/Cyan backgrounds: ~
	* |anokha.vim|, without other options.
	* |paradox.vim|, without other options.

   o  Dark Green backgrounds: ~
	* |anokha.vim|, with |mimic_anokha_alt|option  set to non-Zero.

	NOTE:
	most of these colorschemes look nice with italic fonts, try this: >
		let  mimic_font_style  = 2
<	before loading them (see: |mimic_font_style|).

2.2. Light Colorschemes					*mimic-light-schemes*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   o  Grey/LightGrey backgrounds: ~
	* |dejavu.vim|, by setting 'bg' to "light",
			and the |mimic_dejavu_dark| option to non-Zero.
	* |greyhouse.vim|.
	* |imperial.vim|.
	* |omen.vim|.
	* |vimhut.vim|, by setting 'bg' to "light".

   o  White backgrounds: ~
	* |dejavu.vim|, by setting 'bg' to "light", without other options.
	* |gaea.vim|.
	* |intellij.vim|.
	* |mickeysoft.vim|.
	* |scame.vim|, (emacs)

	NOTE:
	most of these colorschemes look nice with bold fonts, try this: >
		let  mimic_font_style  = 1
<	or if you like bold & italics then do this: >
		let  mimic_font_style  = 3
<	before loading the colorscheme (see: |mimic_font_style|).

==============================================================================
3. Options						*mimic-options*

All the included colorschemes use/share the following common option variables:
	* |mimic_font_style|
	* |mimic_colorize_gui|

	NOTE:
	You can set the scope for any of these and additional colorscheme
	specific option variables to either:  buffer (|b:var|), window
	(|w:var|), tabpage (|t:var|) or global (|g:var|).
	The values are looked-up in that order, and the first one that is
	found is used.

If an option is either NOT set, OR set to 0, the default values from the
colorscheme are used.  To use any of the available options, you need to set it
BEFORE loading any of the included colorschemes; that is, before doing: >
	:colorscheme name_of_scheme
<
An Example: >
	:let mimic_font_style = 2
	:let mimic_colorize_gui = 1
	:color scame
<
	This will load a colorscheme that looks like the default of Emacs and
	sets italic fonts (so that the comments will be cursive) and also sets
	the GUI colors for the menu and toolbar to the colors that Emacs uses
	(only for non-Windows GUIs).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1. Font Style						*mimic_font_style*

By default, all colorschemes are designed to use a plain font style (and they
may use some underline too) but not bold nor italics.  To use such styles you
need to set the |mimic_font_style| variable: >

	let mimic_font_style = numeric_value
<
	Valid values	Description			Notes ~
	------------	-----------			----- ~
		<=0	no bold, no italic fonts.	the DEFAULT.
		  1	use bold fonts.			nice for light bg.
		  2	use italic fonts.		fancy italic comments.
		>=3	use bold and italic fonts.	ok for light bg.

The font styles are only applied to some carefully selected elements, which
each colorscheme does set individually according to ITS idea of beauty and
readability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2. Colorize GUI					*mimic_colorize_gui*

By setting the |mimic_colorize_gui| variable the GUI colors for the Menu,
Toolbar, Scrollbar and Tooltip will also be colored by the chosen colorscheme.
Works for all GUIs except for Windows (and for GTK 2 too? why?...): >

	let mimic_colorize_gui = value
<
	Valid values	Description ~
	------------	----------- ~
		  0	do not change anything.			(the DEFAULT)
		any	set colors for GUI Menu, Toolbar, Scrollbar & Tooltip.

By default, NONE of the included colorscheme does set the colors for the GUI
elements.  Also see: |hl-Menu|, |hl-Scrollbar|, |hl-Tooltip|.

==============================================================================
4. Converted Colorschemes				*mimic-converted*

Under this section are the "ripped-off" ones, with their respective individual
options (if any).  Any colorscheme that is here debuted on another editor or
IDE first.

Note that some of the original colorschemes from other editors or IDEs might
not be easy on the eyes, especially if used for long periods of time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1. Emacs						*mimic-emacs*

From the GNU Emacs Info manual: "Emacs is the extensible, customizable,
self-documenting real-time display editor".  Get it from:
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs

The name Emacs originally stands for "Editor MACroS", but other widely
accepted interpretations of the name are: >
	EMACS			EMACS			EDIT
	Makes			Makes			META
	All			All			ALT
	Computing		Computers		CTRL
	Simple			Slow			SHIFT
<	(hah, hah, sure...)	(this is constant)


DEFAULT							*scame.vim*

SCAME == EMACS (typed backwards).  Emacs look-alike colorscheme for Vim/Gvim.
SCAME may also stand for any of these: >
	Simple			Shiny			*Stallman*
	Colorscheme		Colors			 Cries
	Aims-to			Are			 After-seeing
	Mimic			More			 Moolenaar's
	EMACS			Enlightening		 Editor
<							(my favorite ;) ~
There are several other EMACS look-alike colorschemes for GVim, but this one
tries to be "the frue and only" one.  And in order to achieve that, the colors
of this scheme were DIRECTLY TAKEN FROM GNU EMACS' Face Customization Buffer
(and, as every Vi[M] user knows:  using EMACS is one *hell* of a task!).

This scheme has no extra options besides |mimic-options|.

Recommended settings: ~
  1) use it like it is (with plain fonts), to get the same EMACS look.
  2) but with bold and italic fonts it may look a lot better: >
	:let mimic_font_style = 3
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2. J							*mimic-j*

J is a small and lightweight editor written in Java.  It also has built-in
lisp evaluation (easiest way to avoid Emacs :).  Get it from:
http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/


ANOKHA							*anokha.vim*

A colorscheme with a dark teal background.  The colors have been slightly
modified for GVim (J doesn't have folding, tab colors, etc).

Difference: ~
   The original scheme for J uses a lot of "Yellow" colors for the highlights.
And after trying it like that for a while on GVim, I noticed that it hurts too
much the eyes;  and thus, I changed the "PreProc" (includes, macros, etc.)
highlight group to a "Green" color.
							*anokha-options*
Besides the |mimic-options|, this scheme has the following additional option:

Option			Value	Description ~
------			-----	-----------
*mimic_anokha_alt*	0, or	if not 0, a darkgreen background color is
			  any	   used; else it uses the default color.

Recommended settings: ~
  1) use it like it is (with plain font style).
  2) try it with italics and with a darkgreen background: >
	:let mimic_font_style = 2		" uses italic fonts (comments)
	:let mimic_anokha_alt = 1		" use the alternative colors

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3. MAsmEd						*mimic-masmed*

MAsmEd is (was) a freeware IDE for Assembler (mainly for MASM) for Windows
developed by Frank Charlet.  Now this IDE is called Chrome.  Get it from:
http://pagesperso-orange.fr/franck.charlet/links.html

	NOTE:
	this IDE was called MAsmEd (up to version 0.33 or 0.34), but now it is
	called Chrome (v.1.2).  Old MasmEd link:
	http://hitchhikr.multimania.com/masmed.html


GREY HOUSE						*greyhouse.vim*

This colorscheme from MAsmEd uses a lightgray background, works for Vim/GVim.
This scheme has no extra options besides |mimic-options|.

Difference: ~
   On MAsmEd's original greyhouse scheme, the normal background color is NOT
"lightgray" (#d3d3d3) but more something like a "bluegray" (#C8C8D3).  I've
tried it like that for some hours on GVim, didn't like it (colors get pretty
sick when looking something on a white background after using it); and thus
I've changed it to the former color.

Recommended settings: ~
  1) to get MAsmEd's Greyhouse look and feel: >
	:let mimic_font_style = 2		" it uses italic comments
< 2) try it with bold fonts (or bold + italic fonts): >
	:let mimic_font_style = 1		" with bolds it looks nice
<

MASMED							*masmed.vim*

The colors of this scheme are based upon MAsmEd's originals.  This colorscheme
uses a "dark purple" background color.
							*masmed-options*
Besides the |mimic-options|, this scheme has the following additional option:

Option			Value	Description ~
------			-----	-----------
*mimic_masmed_alt*	0, or	if not 0, an almost black background color is
			  any	   used (Grey20=#333333); else it uses the
				   default color (a dark purple).

Recommended settings: ~
  1) use it like it is (with plain font style), to get MAsmEd's look.
  2) looks nice with italics and alternative background: >
	:let mimic_font_style = 2			" use italics
	:let mimic_masmed_alt = 1			" use alternative bg
<

PARADOX							*paradox.vim*

The green Alien look-alike colorscheme from MAsmEd, now for GVim.  It uses a
"dark teal" background, and quite resembles the look of old Emacs.
							*paradox-options*
Besides the |mimic-options|, this scheme has the following additional option:

Option			Value	Description ~
------			-----	-----------
*mimic_paradox_alt*	0, or	if not 0, an almost black background will be
			  any	   used, else the default (darkteal) is used.

Recommended settings: ~
  1) to get MAsmEd's Paradox look and feel: >
	:let mimic_font_style = 2		" it uses italic comments
< 2) use the alternative background + italics, for every day coding: >
	:let mimic_paradox_alt = 1		" use alternative background
	:let mimic_font_style  = 2		" use italic fonts
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4. IntelliJ IDEA					*mimic-intellij*

IntelliJIDEA is a very powerful and smart IDE for Java.  From its home page: >
	"IntelliJ IDEA lets you code without a hitch. It practices a
	non-intrusive, intuitive approach to help you write, debug, refactor,
	test and learn your code. Thanks to its deep understanding of
	languages and technologies, IntelliJ IDEA provides a second pair of
	hands for you when you need them. Playing the game by your rules
	without ever getting in your way — that's our idea of a productive and
	pleasant development."
<
You can get it from: http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/index.html


DEFAULT							*intellij.vim*

IntelliJIDEA's default colors as of version 4.5.3.
This scheme has no extra options besides |mimic-options|.

Difference: ~
   IntelliJ uses a "DarkBlue" color for almost all the relevant syntax
highlights.  After trying it like that, for two days, I found that it looks
too boring blue.  And thus I changed at least the "PreProc" (imports,
includes, etc.) highlights to "DarkPurple".

Recommended settings: ~
  1) to get IDEA's look and feel. >
	:let mimic_font_style = 3		" it uses bold and italics
<
==============================================================================
5. Original Colorschemes				*mimic-originals*

In this section are the "original" ones.  Any colorscheme that is here was
handcrafted and designed from scratch by me (|mimic-credits|).


BIG BANG						*bigbang.vim*

This is a another ASTRO-like colorscheme for Vim and GVim.  It is inspired
from DrChip's "Astronaut.vim", and from my clone |Astroboy.vim| colorscheme.

This colorscheme uses darker backgrounds for the main syntax elements
(keywords, statements, preprocessor, special, delimiter, etc.) so that
when one looks at any source file it becomes immediately CLEAR what is
being done.

Common language keywords such as: if, else, while, for, etc. are clearly
and very visibly highlighted, and they stand-out among other syntax "
elements.

By default it uses an almost black background color (Grey20 == #333333)
for the GUI; and black for the console.  It may look weird at first, but once
you get used to it you'll like it.  Believe me.

							*bigbang-options*
Besides the |mimic-options|, this scheme has the following additional options:

Option			Value	Description ~
------			-----	-----------
*mimic_bigbang_alt*	0, or	if not 0, a blue background will be used;
			  any	   else it uses the default color (grey20 for
				   the GUI and black for console).
*mimic_bigbang_dark*	0, or	if not 0, a black background color is used.
			  any	   If |mimic_bigbang_alt| is also set, then a
				   darkblue color is used.

   Notes: ~
      * To stop using the darker colors or the blue background either |:unlet|
	the variables or set them to 0, and reload the scheme.
      * CAREFUL with the |mimic_bigbang_alt|option...
	it may create alternative universes...

							*bigbang-variants*
You can get a total of 4 different background colors with this colorscheme,
according to how you set the option variables.  Here is an overview of them: >

 alt	dark	GUI main/syntax bgs	Console main/syntax bgs
 ---	----	-------------------	-----------------------
< 0	 0	  grey20 / black	   black / blue
  0	 1	   black / grey20	   black / darkblue
  1	 0	    blue / darkblue	    blue / darkblue
  1	 1	darkblue / blue		darkblue / black(*)

   Notes:
	 alt = |mimic_bigbang_alt|
	dark = |mimic_bigbang_dark|
	   * =  black looks better than blue, on darkblue in Vim.

Recommended settings: ~
  1) Default bg in Gvim using italics: >
	:let mimic_font_style = 2
< 2) To use Darkblue/Blue in GVim and Darkblue/Black in Console for the
     main and syntax groups backgrounds respectively: >
	:let mimic_bigbang_alt = 1
	:let mimic_bigbang_dark = 1
< 3) To use Black/Grey20 in GVim and Black/Darkblue in Vim for the
     main and syntax groups backgrounds respectively: >
	:let mimic_bigbang_dark = 1
< 4) To get a look like Astronaut.vim but using italic fonts: >
	:let mimic_bigbang_alt = 1
	:let mimic_bigbang_dark = 1
	:let mimic_font_style = 2
< 5) For something exotic (in GVim) try this: >
	:let mimic_bigbang_alt = 1
	:let mimic_bigbang_dark = 1
	:let mimic_font_style = 2
	:color bigbang
	:hi Normal guibg=black
<

DEEP BLUE						*deepblue.vim*

My very own vision of a "DarkBlue" colorscheme, but only for |GVim|.
This scheme has no extra options besides |mimic-options|.

Recommended settings: ~
  1) use it like it is (with plain font style).


DEJA VU							*dejavu.vim*

Original colorscheme for Vim/GVim.  Very customizable, uses colors according
to the value of the 'background' option.  Mainly intended to be used for night
coding/hacks (if you work at some Astronomic Observatory :).

Inspired and powered by DnB (Drum & Bass) music (Spor, Break, Andy C, Sub
focus, Prodigy ;).  Try out it with: >
	:set bg=dark    |   color dejavu
	:set bg=light   |   color dejavu
<
							*dejavu-features*
Features: ~
   * Appealing and easy-on-the-eyes colors.
   * Colors are set according to the current 'background' type (in Vim/GVim).
   * 6 different background color variants for GUI and Cterm with foreground
        colors looking the same on them (see |dejavu-variants|).
   * GUI font styles can be easily changed with the |mimic_font_style|
	option (just like with any other colorscheme from the |mimicpak|).

							*dejavu-options*
Besides the |mimic-options|, this scheme has the following additional options:

Option			Value	Description ~
------			-----	-----------
*mimic_dejavu_alt*	0, or	if not 0, a dark blue background will be used
			  any	   (only for dark 'background').
*mimic_dejavu_dark*	0, or	if not 0, a more darker background color will
			  any	   be used.  For dark 'background' "black" is
				   used and for light 'background' LightGray
				   (or similar color) is used.
				   And if |mimic_dejavu_alt| is not 0, then
				   a very "darkblue" color is used.
   Notes: ~
      * To stop using the darker colors or the blue background either |:unlet|
	the variables or set them to 0, and reload the scheme.
      * To get the best look, leave the |mimic_font_style| variable like it
	is if you use a "dark" 'background', but use Bold and/or Italics for
	"light" 'background'.

							*dejavu-variants*
You can get a total of 6 different color variations with this colorscheme,
according to how you set the option variables and Vim's 'background' option.
Here is an overview of them:
>

6. Cloned Colorschemes					*mimic-cloned*

In this section are some "cloned" schemes.  The colorschemes itself were made
from scratch, but the colors are BASED from other existing colorschemes which
I liked.

The purpose of these cloned schemes is: >
	provide EASIER ON THE EYES colors (better contrast),
	and still look like the original.
<

ASTRO BOY						*astroboy.vim*

GVim only colorscheme.  The colors of this scheme are based on DrChip's
(Dr. Charles E. Campbell, Jr., Ph.D.) cool Astronaut colorscheme, except that
it uses an almost black background color (Grey20 == #333333) by default;
and it uses smoother (not so bright) colors.

You can get the original Astronaut scheme here:
	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=122

							*astroboy-options*
Besides the |mimic-options|, this scheme has the following additional options:

Option			Value	Description ~
------			-----	-----------
*mimic_astroboy_alt*	0, or	if not 0, a blue background will be used;
			  any	   else it uses the default color (grey20).
*mimic_astroboy_dark*	0, or	if not 0, a black background color is used.
			  any	   If |mimic_astroboy_alt| is also set, then a
				   darkblue color is used.

   Notes: ~
      * To stop using the darker colors or the blue background either |:unlet|
	the variables or set them to 0, and reload the scheme.

							*astroboy-variants*
You can get a total of 4 different background colors with this colorscheme,
according to how you set the option variables.  Here is an overview of them: >

	alt	dark	What the background looks like
 	---	----	------------------------------
<	0	0	almost black background similar to Desert.vim
	0	1	real black background
	1	0	blue background similar to Astronaut.vim
	1	1	dark blue background, similar to darkblue.vim

   Notes:
	 alt = |mimic_astroboy_alt|
	dark = |mimic_astroboy_dark|

Recommended settings: ~
  1) use it like it is (with plain font style), or
  2) to get the same look as Astronaut.vim (uses blue background) >
	:let mimic_astroboy_alt = 1
< 3) or try Black background color and italic fonts. >
	:let mimic_astroboy_dark = 1
	:let mimic_font_style = 2
< 4) Alternative Dark Blue background with italic fonts. >
	:let mimic_astroboy_alt = 1
	:let mimic_astroboy_dark = 1
	:let mimic_font_style = 2
<

MICKEYSOFT						*mickeysoft.vim*

YAMC == Yet Another Mickey$oft Colorscheme... for GVim.
Colors look (more or less) like those used in M$ IDEs.

This scheme has no extra options besides |mimic-options|.

Recommended settings: ~
  1) looks nice with bold and italics fonts: >
	:let mimic_font_style = 3		" use bolds and italics
<

PS CLONE						*psclone.vim*

This scheme is based on the popular peaksea.vim (aka "ps_color.vim") made by
Pan, Shizhu and which is in the Top 10 colorschemes on: http://vim.sf.net/.

I like and have used the peaksea colorscheme a lot...  However I wanted to
have more smoother (read: not so bright) colors.  So I decided to make this
clone scheme with a background color similar to the desert.vim colorscheme and
a lighter cast of colors based on the ones of peaksea.

It may look very dull at first but it is very, very easy on the eyes
(and perhaps even better than the original peaksea ;).

Differences: ~
   The main differences between  peaksea  and this clone scheme are:
      * it is {only for GVim} (no cterm colors);
      * it does NOT have/use any of the peaksea options;
      * it does NOT have different set of colors (i.e. cool/warm/whatever);
      * it uses the |mimic-options|, and so the font styles can easily be
	   changed via the |mimic_font_style| option.

This scheme has no extra options besides |mimic-options|.

Recommended settings: ~
  1) looks nice with italic fonts: >
	:let mimic_font_style = 2		" use italics
<

VIM HUT							*vimhut.vim*

This colorscheme uses very similar colors to GVim's defaults but with a darker
tone and with more gray.  Furthermore, it uses a different set of colors
according to the current 'background'.  Try them with: >
	:set bg=dark    |   color vimhut
	:set bg=light   |   color vimhut

This scheme is only included in this pack because I wondered how the GVim
default colors may look on a dark 'background'.

This scheme has no extra options besides |mimic-options|.

Recommended settings: ~
  1) on dark 'background', it looks nice with italic fonts: >
	:let mimic_font_style = 2
< 2) on light 'background', it looks nice with bold fonts: >
	:let mimic_font_style = 1

9. Links						*mimic-links*

Some links to some very nice colorschemes and plugins related to schemes
(not included in the Vim runtime by default) and that you might find useful:

   *  hicolors			by Charles E. Campbell, Jr. (aka DrChip) >
	Very useful colorscheme editor.  Supports editing of GUI and cterm
	(8/16/256) colors in a WYSIWYG-like mode with a simple interface.
<	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1081

   *  CSApprox.vim		by Matt Woznisky >
	Another very useful plugin for terminal refugees.  It allows you to
	use GVim-only colorschemes (like the included ones in this pack) with
	Vim on 88/256 color terminals (xterm, rxvt, konsole, eterm, etc.)
<	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2390

   *  astronaut.vim		by Charles E. Campbell, Jr. (aka DrChip) >
	This scheme is great for Vim, especially when using it on a terminal
	emulator that supports (pseudo)transparent backgrounds such as
	Konsole.
<	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=122

	Also, if you like this colorscheme you may want to try the included
	clone from this Pack |astroboy.vim| (which is only for GVim and it
	uses smoother [not so sharp] colors and has options to use different
	background colors).  The |bigbang.vim| colorscheme can also be good
	alternative.

   *  peaksea.vim		by Pan Shizhu >
	This colorscheme uses different sets of colors (dark/light) according
	to the current value of the 'background' option.  The colors for
	'dark' backgrounds are really good and easy-on-the-eyes.  However, the
	colors for 'light' backgrounds are another story...
<	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=760

	Also, if you like this colorscheme you may want to try the included
	clone from this Pack |psclone.vim| (which uses similar colors based on
	the dark colors of peaksea, but with a smoother tones, a la "desert").

   *  zenburn.vim		by Jani Nurminen >
	This one is one of my favorites, very good for late night coding in
	the dark.
<	http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=415

==============================================================================
B. TODO							*mimic-todo*

Things that may be added(+), changed(*) or deleted(-) ~
in a possible future update: ~
	* Use the font style option also for term/cterm.
	* Instead of using numbers for the font style, use a string of
	  words/chars (example: 'b,i' to use bold and italic; or
	  'bold und ital' to use bold, underline, and italics...
	  this isn't hard to do.)
	* Change the way that font styles are set.  The current way is
	  practical but is also slow and stupid  (the schemes first set the
	  highlights with gui=NONE; and after all are set, they set again
	  the gui option to the chosen font style for all groups...)
	* I need to create a better template for future schemes.
	+ Add colorschemes from other vim users?
	+ Include my template scheme? (so that others can use it?)
>
	All these may take a GOOD TIME...  Because they imply, that I need to
	change all the 17 colorschemes again and the entire documentation as
	well.
<
==============================================================================
B. FAQ							*mimic-faq*

Questions that Vim users have asked: ~
   NONE, so far.

Questions that some Vim users MIGHT want to ask: ~
   Q:  Why did you do all this stuff?  WHYYYYYY?!
   A: >
	I have used the IDEs/Editors mentioned above and I was waiting for
	somebody else to convert the colors to GVim (particularly the ones
	from MAsmEd: Paradox, Greyhouse)...  Sure, the colors of Emacs already
	existed for GVim; but I wanted to have the very same ones (if possible).

	Since nobody else did this, I decided to start doing it.

	I have also tried ALL (yes ALL, one by one) of the colorschemes from
	Robert Melton's ColorSamplerPack, and I was looking for GVim
	colorschemes that use easy on the eyes colors.  Well, I found less
	than 10 of them:

		* camo.vim
		* desert.vim (already distributed with vim).
		* jellybeans.vim
		* metacosm.vim
		* peaksea.vim (only the colors for dark backgrounds)
		* zenburn.vim

	just to mention some.  This was clearly not enough for me, and thus I
	decided to make my own easy-on-the-eyes colorschemes for GVIM:

		* astroboy.vim, (astronaut.vim enhanced GVIM clone)
		* dejavu.vim,
		* imperial.vim,
		* omen.vim,
		* psclone.vim, (peaksea.vim [aka ps_color] clone)
		* vimhut.vim,
		* zendnb.vim.

	Furthermore, I like to use different font styles every now and then...
	So I've added the shared mimic-options, an easy way to switch font
	styles and get the same look on all the included colorschemes.
<

   Q:  Will you add more colorschemes to this pack?
   A: >
	NOPE.  With these I have enough (for the moment).
<

   Q:  Seeing the Hadou-ken at the top of this file, I know that you're a
	M.U.G.E.N master, so please tell me:
	How can I DO a *SHINKUU-TATSUMAKI-SENPUU-KYAKU* in real life ?

   A:	Follow these simple steps, as shown in the pictures:

	NOTE: the  ^^^  means that the action is performed while airbone.

	Details: ~
	*  Step 1: charging energy. >
		This is the MOST important step, so take ALL the time you need
		to charge YOUR ENERGY while you say the word "SHINKUU" and keep
		those "U"s sounding...  People will panic and flee away in
		fear once they notice your intimidating pose.
<
	*  Step 2: going airbone. >
		After you have charged fully YOUR ENERGY (i.e. once you notice
		EARTHQUAKES and SMALL ROCKS FLOATING), you need to:
		spin-180-degrees-quickly-and-hit-the-ground-with-your-foot-as-
		hard-as-possible-while-saying-TATSUMAKI...
		(all that in less than 1 sec).  This will allow you to jump
		more higher than otherwise you would.
<
	*  Step 3: begin to spin in mid-air. >
		Once in mid-air, open your legs to 90~100 degrees (as shown in
		picture 3) and start to spin imitating a helix...
		Steps 2 and 3 should take you no longer than 2 secs!
<
	*  Step 4, 5 and 6: keep spinning. >
		This is the easiest part, you ONLY NEED TO KEEP SPINNING LIKE
		A HELICOPTER IN MID-AIR, IGNORING GRAVITY as shown in the
		pictures.  Once you reach step 6, repeat again from step 3.

		After the 10th. spin you should see a HEAVY TORNADO with
		CLOUDS and THUNDER around yourself...  Every Vim user, that is
		worth of being named as such, should see it!

		If you SOMEHOW just can't do this, then PRACTICE more!
		Practice makes perfection! ;)

		Additionally you could try to jump-off from a skyscrapper
		(or cliff), and see how many spins you can do in mid-air
		before you hit the ground... if you manage to get to 10,
		e-mail me! ;)
<
	[And if you still don't know what a |SHINKUU-TATSUMAKI-SENPUU-KYAKU|
	 is all about, don't ask me!  Ask google, google is your friend.]

	OK, enough silliness and stupidity for now :-S
